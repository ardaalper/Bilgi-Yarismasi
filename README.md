This is the third Unity-based basic game project on my github account. I made 
this project in the tutorial of "Learn Unity in C# & Code Your First Five 2D 
Video Games for Web, Mac & PC. The Tutorials Cover Tilemap" from Udemy. I learnt
and applied the logic of user menu, button interactions and compact game design
for further changes.
